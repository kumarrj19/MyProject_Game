This is a simple toss game developed as a practice exercise. The game is similar to what we studied in class and involves guessing the outcome of a toss.

## How to Play

1. The player guesses whether the toss will result in heads or tails.

4. An alert message in the browser window indicates whether the guess was correct or not.
