I made a simple toss game similar to what we studied in class. In the game, when our guess is correct, our score increases by 1, and the number of attempts also increases.
If our guess is incorrect, the score remains the same, but the number of attempts increases. For each guess, we get an alert message in the browser window indicating whether 
our guess is correct or not.
